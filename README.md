# demo-repo-1
A demo repo to test the url changes

This has now been moved to the Assurity-Demoted organsation.... I'm editing this in the Web UI!

And now I have edited this via a local clone (still using the old remote pointing to Assurity-Demo):
As per the following `git remote -v` output
origin	git@github.com:Assurity-Demo/demo-repo-1.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:Assurity-Demo/demo-repo-1.git (push)

Now adding further changes after transferring ownership to Assurity org!
